### What are ports?
1. virtual point where network connections start and end
2. managed by a computer's operating system
3. Each port is associated with a specific process or service
4. allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages


### What is reverse proxy
1. reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client (e.g. web browser) requests to those web servers
2. typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability

### What is a proxy server
1. server that sits in front of a group of client machines
2. computers make requests to sites and services on the Internet, the proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients

### How is reverse proxy different
1. reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting requests from clients
2. different from a forward proxy, where the proxy sits in front of the clients. With a reverse proxy, when clients send requests to the origin server of a website
3.  forward proxy sits in front of a client and ensures that no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client. On the other hand, a reverse proxy sits in front of an origin server and ensures that no client ever communicates directly with that origin server

5. Run command
```

```
6. create the file using the vi editor
```
vi reverse-proxy.conf

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse-proxy.conf
```
9. Test Nginx and the Nginx Reverse Proxy:
```
service nginx configtest
